repoze.debug Changes
====================

0.7.1 (2010-03-11)
------------------

- Sphinxified docs.

- Don't compute tracelog records unless we are going to write them.


0.7 (2009/09/06)
----------------

- The iterator returned by an application was closed too soon when
  using the responselogger middleware, resulting in, e.g. errors from
  paste.fileapp complaining about "file already closed".

- If the ``keep`` parameter in the "responselogger" middleware is set
  to zero, no entries are logged (not even one, as previously may have
  happened).

- Better test coverage.

- Ignore HTTP errors in post-mortem debug middleware. The exceptions
  we want to catch here are application-level. A configuration option
  has been added to keep the old behavior.

- Added middleware "threads" to debug threads (based on an adaptation
  of Florent Guillaume's "DeadlockDebugger" product for Zope 2).

0.6.2 (2008/07/03)
------------------

- Show a "short" URL in the debug UI.

0.6.1 (2008/07/03)
------------------

- Fix debug UI bug: show escaped body regardless of content-type.

0.6 (2008/07/02)
----------------

- Fix logging bug.  Symptom: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no
  attribute 'info'

0.5 (2008/06/30)
----------------

- Make debug request id reflect approximate UNIX time rather than a
  random debug id.

- Deal with responses via a generator; don't unwind response bodies
  into memory.

- Default max_bodysize is now 3K rather than the entire response
  body.

- User interface; keep entries around to show in GUI.  See
  /__repoze.debug/static/debugui.html.

- We now write two logs: a verbose log, and a trace log.  The verbose
  log contains information about headers, request information,
  response bodies, etc.  The trace log is more compact and is written
  in essence to be parsed by a tool.

- The 'filename' option in Paste config is now 'verbose_log'.

- Port Zope's 'requestprofiler' script to WSGI.  Invoke via
  'wsgirequestprofiler' to see help; operates against 'trace' log.

0.4 (2008/06/25)
----------------

- Add pdbpm middleware for dropping into the post-mortem debugger upon
  an exception (copied from repoze.errorlog).

0.3 (2008/06/25)
----------------

- Add 'canary' middleware for detecting environment dictionary leaks.
  Add to your Paste config via 'egg:repoze.debug#canary'; it takes no
  arguments.  If refcounts to repoze.debug.canary.Canary grow without
  bound, you know you are leaking WSGI environment dictionaries.

- Add source url to response logging.

0.2 (2008/06/14)
----------------

- Add warning if content-length != body length.

0.1 (2008/06/13)
----------------

- Initial release.
